			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>The primary goal of this project was to gather data within a five day span using the app Instagram. This data would 
			then provide insight into my own personal daily habits in terms of amount of activity and the type of activity produced.
			I specifically chose to monitor factors such as the subject of the post, as well as who was posting and what my relationship
			with this poster was.</p>

				<p>The data collection process left me with a slew of data that had nowhere to go. There was a lot of information that needed to be 
				desperately organized into some visual aspect. Enter: <em>temporal chart</em>. I initially chose this chart type in order to showcase my 
				findings in a way that yielded immediate, if not superficial, results.</p>

				<h2>Instagram and Psychographics</h2>
				<p>After having made the temporal chart, I then conducted research in order to dig deeper into Instagram and its algorithm. During this
				research, I focused on psychographics and how Instagram utilized this process to better formulate individual user's timelines. </p>
