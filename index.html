			<h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
			<p>The primary goal of this project was to gather data within a five day span using the app Instagram. This data would 
			then provide insight into my own personal daily habits in terms of amount of activity and the type of activity produced and 
			through this process I would then go on to be able to analyze factors such as psychographics and how Instagram's personal 
			algorithm affected the material of my own personal account.</p>
			<p>During the collection process, I specifically chose to monitor factors such as the subject of the post, as well as who was 
			posting and what my relationship with this poster was. This was all catalogued on a Google spreadsheet, shown on the right.</p>

				<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
				<p>The data collection process left me with a slew of data that had nowhere to go. There was a lot of information that needed to be 
				desperately organized into some visual aspect. Enter: <em>temporal chart</em>. I initially chose this chart type in order to showcase my 
				findings in a way that yielded immediate, if not superficial, results.

				<h2>Instagram and Psychographics</h2>
				<p>After having made the temporal chart, I then conducted research in order to dig deeper into Instagram and its algorithm. During this
				research, I focused on psychographics and how Instagram utilized this process to better formulate individual user's timelines. </p>
				<p>The primary goal of this project was to gather data and determine what my own personal story was/is. There was a large
			range of subjects from which I could have chosen, but the Instagram app was something that was both easily accessible and something
			that I knew I used every day. At the end of this project, I learned things like how much I used the app, how my own day-to-day life
			affected my use of this app, and also gained insight into how Instagram utilizes its psychographic algorithm to better tailor each
			user's feed.</p>
